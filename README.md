## 🌟 Overview

**Pico Connector** is a lightweight, reliable, non-polling Home Assistant
integration that turns **Lutron Caseta Pico remotes** into powerful light
controllers.

It listens directly to `lutron_caseta_button_event` and applies intuitive
dimming behavior:

### ✔ Paddle Pico Behavior

- **Short Press ON** → Sets configurable brightness (default: 100%)
- **Short Press OFF** → Turns off
- **Long Press ON** → Ramps up brightness
- **Long Press OFF** → Ramps down brightness
- Automatically stops when max/min brightness is reached

### ✔ 5-Button Pico Behavior (Pico3RaiseLower & true 5-button models)

- **ON** → immediate brightness_on_pct
- **OFF** → immediate off
- **STOP** → halts ramping
- **RAISE / LOWER** → ramps immediately (no hold timer)

This integration requires **no polling**, uses **async**, and is extremely
responsive.
